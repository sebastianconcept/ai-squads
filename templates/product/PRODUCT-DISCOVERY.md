## 5. Feature Prioritization Framework

### Jobs to be Done
[What jobs is the product hired to do?]

**Primary Job:**

### Feature Evaluation Criteria
[How do we decide what to build?]

**Evaluation Questions:**
1. **Does it serve a core job?** (Must answer yes)
2. **Does it validate an assumption?** (Should answer yes)
3. **Does it move product-market fit metrics?** (Should answer yes)
4. **Is it essential for MVP?** (For MVP features only)
5. **What's the effort vs. impact?** (High impact, low effort = prioritize)

**Scoring:**
- **Must Build:** Serves core job + validates assumption + moves metrics
- **Should Build:** Serves core job + (validates assumption OR moves metrics)
- **Could Build:** Serves core job but doesn't validate or move metrics (post-MVP)
- **Won't Build:** Doesn't serve core job

### Build vs. Buy vs. Partner
[Decision framework]

**Build:**
- [When to build - e.g., Core differentiator, strategic capability]

**Buy:**
- [When to buy - e.g., Non-core functionality, faster to market]

**Partner:**
- [When to partner - e.g., Complementary capability, distribution]

### What NOT to Build
[Explicit non-goals and why]

**Non-Goals:**
- [Feature 1]: [Why not - e.g., Doesn't serve core job]
- [Feature 2]: [Why not - e.g., Doesn't validate assumption]
- [Feature 3]: [Why not - e.g., Doesn't move metrics]

**Decision Rationale:**
- Focus on product-market fit validation first
- Build only what serves core jobs
- Avoid "nice to have" features until after validation
