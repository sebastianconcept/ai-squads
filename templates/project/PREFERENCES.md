# Project Preferences

**Interaction language:** English

This is the language agents use when talking to you (explanations, questions, summaries). Change the line above to override—for example, `**Interaction language:** Portuguese` or `**Interaction language:** Spanish`. Code, identifiers, and technical terms stay unchanged.

**Preferred UI stack:** (optional) e.g. SvelteKit, SkeletonUI, Tailwind. When set, the UI Developer agent (uidev) and UX agent prefer this stack when TECH-STACK is not yet defined.
