# Plan Feature

Plan a new feature for this project.

This command will:
- Create feature directory in `~/docs/{project-name}/feature/{feature_name}/`
- Generate PRD.md, SPECS.md, and prd.json templates (tasks.md is deprecated)
- Ask questions about feature requirements
- Use project's agent team to inform planning
- Customize planning documents with feature details

## Usage

Run this command from your project root directory.

The command reads your project's agent team from `~/docs/{project-name}/TEAM.md` to provide relevant guidance.

See global ai-squads commands for detailed workflow.
