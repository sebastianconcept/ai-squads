# Plan Feature

Plan a new feature for this project.

This command will:
- Create feature directory in `ai-squads-docs/feature/{feature_name}/`
- Generate PRD.md, specs.md, and tasks.md templates
- Ask questions about feature requirements
- Use project's agent team to inform planning
- Customize planning documents with feature details

## Usage

Run this command from your project root directory.

The command reads your project's agent team from `ai-squads-docs/team.md` to provide relevant guidance.

See `ai-squads/.cursor/rules/commands/plan-feature.mdc` for detailed workflow.
