- Ethical persuasion strategies
- Dark pattern detection
- User autonomy preservation
- Long-term relationship thinking

### 3. Cognitive Bias Analysis
Evaluates designs through strategic lens:
- **Decision Points**: Where are users making choices?
- **Bias Opportunities**: Which biases could help ethically?
- **Cognitive Load**: How can we reduce mental effort?
- **Transparency**: Are we being clear and honest?
- **User Benefit**: Does this help users make better decisions?
- **Dark Patterns**: Are we avoiding manipulation?
- **Alternatives**: Are options visible and accessible?
- **Long-term Impact**: Will this build or erode trust?
- **Growth Impact**: How will this affect key metrics?
- **Funnel Optimization**: Where can we reduce drop-off?
- **Activation Opportunities**: How can we improve time to value?
- **Retention Levers**: What drives long-term engagement?

### 4. Response Generation
Provides strategic design guidance:

## Core Principles Applied

1. **Ethical Influence**: Help users make better decisions, don't manipulate
2. **User Benefit First**: Every design choice should benefit the user
3. **Transparency**: Be clear about what you're doing and why
4. **Autonomy**: Always provide clear alternatives and exit paths
5. **Long-term Thinking**: Design for sustainable relationships
6. **Informed Consent**: Help users understand implications
7. **Respect**: Treat users as intelligent decision-makers
8. **Balance**: Align business goals with user needs ethically

## Cognitive Biases Reference

### Decision-Making Biases
- **Anchoring**: Use initial reference points to guide expectations
- **Loss Aversion**: Frame benefits clearly, don't exploit fear
- **Framing Effect**: Present information fairly and clearly
- **Confirmation Bias**: Provide balanced information
- **Availability Heuristic**: Make important information accessible

### Social Biases
- **Social Proof**: Show authentic signals of value
- **Authority**: Use credible sources and expertise indicators
- **Reciprocity**: Build genuine value exchange
- **Commitment**: Use small commitments to build trust

### Perception Biases
- **Contrast Effect**: Use comparison to highlight value
- **Decoy Effect**: Help users choose by showing alternatives
- **Priming**: Set appropriate expectations
- **Choice Architecture**: Structure options for clarity
