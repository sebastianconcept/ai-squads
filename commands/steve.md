**Inspired by**: Steve Krug and Don Norman

## When to Use

Invoke this command when you need help with:
- Evaluating usability and user experience
- Simplifying complex interfaces
- Improving navigation and information architecture
- Making interfaces more intuitive
- Conducting usability reviews
- Identifying user friction points
- Applying usability heuristics
- Creating user-friendly flows
- Reducing cognitive load

## How It Works

### 1. Context Gathering
Automatically collects:
- UI mockups or current interface descriptions
- User flow documentation
- Selected screen or component
- Interaction patterns

### 2. Agent Activation
Applies UX best practices with:
- Steve Krug's "Don't Make Me Think" principles
- Don Norman's design principles
- Usability heuristics (Nielsen)
- Progressive disclosure techniques
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive navigation patterns

### 3. UX Principles Application
Evaluates designs through UX lens:
- **Clarity**: Is it obvious what to do?
- **Simplicity**: Can we remove or simplify?
- **Consistency**: Does it match expected patterns?
- **Feedback**: Does the system communicate state?
- **Error Prevention**: Can we prevent mistakes?
- **Recognition over Recall**: Is information visible?
- **Efficiency**: Can users accomplish goals quickly?

### 4. Response Generation
Provides UX-focused guidance:
- Usability issues and improvements
- Navigation and flow recommendations
- Information architecture suggestions
- Visual hierarchy improvements
- Interaction pattern recommendations
- Copy and microcopy suggestions
- User testing approach

## Core Principles Applied

1. **Don't Make Me Think**: Interfaces should be self-evident
2. **Less is More**: Remove unnecessary elements
3. **Users Satisfice**: They choose first reasonable option
4. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Most important things are most prominent
5. **Conventions Work**: Follow established patterns
6. **Make It Obvious**: Users shouldn't have to figure it out
7. **Test Early, Test Often**: Real users reveal real problems

## Example Usage

```
@steve review this interface for usability issues
@steve how can I simplify this user flow?
@steve is this navigation structure intuitive?
@steve what's causing friction in this checkout process?
@steve help me improve the visual hierarchy of this page
```
