# Adopt Project

Initialize this project with ai-squads system.

This command will:
- Create `ai-squads-docs/` directory with project documentation templates
- Set up `.cursor/commands/` with project-specific commands
- Ask questions about mission, tech stack, and roadmap
- Configure agent team based on tech stack
- Save team configuration to `ai-squads-docs/team.md`

## Usage

Run this command from your project root directory where ai-squads is installed as a submodule.

The command will detect the ai-squads submodule location and use its rules and templates.

See `ai-squads/.cursor/rules/commands/adopt-project.mdc` for detailed workflow.
