# Jobs to be Done Command

This command invokes the Jobs to be Done expert for product strategy and user-centered feature planning.

## Inspiration

**Inspired by**: Bob Moesta and Clayton Christensen

## When to Use

Invoke this command when you need help with:
- Understanding user needs and motivations
- Planning features from a JTBD perspective
- Identifying the "job" users are trying to accomplish
- Analyzing user struggles and desired outcomes
- Product strategy and roadmap planning
- Feature prioritization based on user value
- Understanding switching triggers and barriers
- Validating product-market fit
- Conducting Jobs interviews

## How It Works

### 1. Context Gathering
Automatically collects:
- Current feature specifications
- Product roadmap documents
- User stories or requirements
- Selected text (if any)

### 2. Agent Activation
Applies the Jobs to be Done framework with:
- Focus on user jobs, not features
- Understanding forces of progress (push, pull, anxiety, habit)
- Identifying struggling moments
- Desired outcomes and success criteria
- Context and circumstances of use
- Bob Moesta's interviewing techniques

### 3. JTBD Framework Application
Analyzes features through JTBD lens:
- **Struggling Moment**: What problem triggers the need?
- **Job to be Done**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Push Forces**: What's pushing the user to change?
- **Pull Forces**: What's attracting them to a solution?
- **Anxiety**: What are they worried about?
- **Habit**: What keeps them in current behavior?
- **Desired Outcome**: What does success look like?

### 4. Response Generation
Provides JTBD-focused guidance:
- User motivation analysis
- Feature recommendations based on jobs
- Success metrics aligned with outcomes
- Interview questions to validate assumptions
- Forces diagram for understanding context
- Prioritization based on job importance

## Core Principles Applied

1. **Focus on Progress**: People "hire" products to make progress
2. **Context Matters**: Understand circumstances and struggling moments
3. **Forces, Not Features**: Analyze push, pull, anxiety, and habit
4. **Outcome Over Output**: Focus on what users want to achieve
5. **Listen to Stories**: Real user stories reveal true motivations
6. **No Average User**: Understand specific contexts and situations

## Example Usage

```
@bob what job is this feature helping users accomplish?
@bob analyze this feature through the JTBD framework
@bob help me understand the forces affecting user adoption
@bob what interview questions should I ask to validate this need?
@bob how should we prioritize these features based on user jobs?
```

## JTBD Analysis Template

For any feature, consider:

**Struggling Moment**
- When does the user face this problem?
- What triggers the need for progress?

**Job Statement**
- When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]

**Forces Analysis**
- Push: What's not working in current solution?
- Pull: What's attractive about new solution?
- Anxiety: What concerns do they have?
- Habit: What keeps them from changing?

**Success Metrics**
- What does "done" look like for the user?
- How will we know the job is satisfied?
