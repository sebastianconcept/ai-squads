# Problem: Prelaunch Page Improvement

## Problem Statement
The current prelaunch page doesn't align with our Modern SaaS Design System and fails to optimize for conversion based on our growth strategy. The page lacks visual hierarchy, proper color usage, and conversion-focused copy that addresses the specific pain points of Brazilian accountants.

## User Impact
- **Poor Visual Appeal**: Current design doesn't reflect the professional, modern aesthetic needed to build trust with accountants
- **Low Conversion Rates**: Generic messaging doesn't address specific pain points or create urgency
- **Brand Inconsistency**: Colors and typography don't match our design system, creating confusion
- **Missing Social Proof**: No testimonials, case studies, or credibility indicators
- **Weak Value Proposition**: Current copy doesn't clearly communicate the time-saving benefits

## Business Impact
- **Reduced Lead Quality**: Poor design may attract unqualified leads
- **Lower Trial-to-Paid Conversion**: Weak value proposition doesn't set proper expectations
- **Missed Growth Opportunities**: Not leveraging our growth strategy's content pillars
- **Brand Perception Issues**: Inconsistent design hurts professional credibility
- **SEO Underperformance**: Missing structured content for search optimization

## Current State
The prelaunch page currently features:
- Basic dark theme with blue accents (not aligned with design system)
- Simple email capture form with minimal validation
- Generic rotating text messages
- No social proof or credibility indicators
- Missing conversion optimization elements
- No clear value proposition or benefit communication

## Desired State
A conversion-optimized prelaunch page that:
- Follows our Modern SaaS Design System (green/lime primary, proper typography)
- Implements growth strategy messaging focused on time-saving for accountants
- Includes social proof and credibility indicators
- Features clear value proposition with specific benefits
- Optimizes for Brazilian accountant pain points
- Includes conversion elements like urgency, scarcity, and risk reversal

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing HTMX/Alpine.js functionality
- Should preserve current lead capture backend integration
- Must be responsive and accessible
- Should load quickly (performance requirements)
- Must align with Brazilian Portuguese language and cultural context
