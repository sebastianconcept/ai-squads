# BankFlow Mission

> Last Updated: December 2024
> Version: 1.0

## Pitch

BankFlow is a microSaaS that transforms Brazilian bank statement normalization from a manual, time-consuming process into an automatic, instant solution. We liberate accountants to focus on strategic consulting by automating the tedious work of converting bank statements from different formats into standardized data.

- **Medium Accounting Offices** (15,000 offices): 5-20 employees, 50-200 clients, seeking efficiency
- **Scale-up CFOs** (5,000 companies): Startups/scale-ups with multiple bank accounts, need consolidation

### User Personas

## The Problem

### Manual Bank Statement Processing

Brazilian accountants spend 5+ hours per week manually converting bank statements from different formats (PDF, CSV, XLS) into standardized data. Each bank has unique layouts, date formats, and field structures, making automation nearly impossible without specialized tools.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered parsing engine that automatically detects bank formats and converts them to standardized CSV/JSON output in under 30 seconds.

### Error-Prone Manual Data Entry

Manual transcription leads to 12% error rate in financial data, causing client dissatisfaction and potential compliance issues. Accountants must double-check every entry, adding hours to the process.

**Our Solution:** 99%+ accuracy automated conversion with validation checks and error reporting, eliminating manual transcription errors.

### Time Drain on High-Value Work

Accountants spend 80% of their time on data processing instead of strategic consulting, limiting their ability to provide high-value services to clients and grow their practice.

**Our Solution:** 80% time reduction in statement processing, allowing accountants to focus on analysis, planning, and client consultation.
