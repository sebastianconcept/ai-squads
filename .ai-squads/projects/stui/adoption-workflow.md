# STUI Project Adoption Workflow

## Adoption Summary

**Project**: STUI (Network-enabled Terminal IDE for Smalltalk Development)  
**Adoption Date**: 2025-08-23  
**Squad**: Elite Squad (Rust and Smalltalk/Pharo Development)  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Adopted

## Adoption Process Completed

### 1. Project Assessment ✅
- **Repository Analysis**: Clean git status, active development with multiple worktrees
- **Technology Stack**: Rust TUI client + Smalltalk/Pharo backend + ZeroMQ networking
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 completed, Phase 2 active (weeks 1-4)
- **Test Coverage**: 88+ tests passing, comprehensive integration testing

### 2. Squad Alignment ✅
- **Elite Squad Match**: Perfect fit for Rust and Smalltalk/Pharo development focus
- **Technology Alignment**: ZeroMQ networking, systems programming, full-stack development
- **Agent Availability**: All required agents available in Elite squad
- **Workflow Compatibility**: High-performance, memory-efficient development standards

### 3. Project Integration ✅
- **Project Structure**: Created `ai-squads/projects/stui/` directory
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation and status
- **Workflow Integration**: Elite squad development workflow activated
- **Agent Coordination**: Software engineer agent ready for Rust/Smalltalk development

## Current Project State

### Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅
- Terminal detection and capability querying
- Window management system (panels, splits, overlays)
- Keyboard input handling and command routing
- **ZeroMQ Pharo integration** (MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT)
- **JSON Protocol implementation** (88+ tests passing)
- **Complete Rust TUI client** (Professional interface)
- Simple workspace for code evaluation
- Basic transcript integration

### Phase 2: ACTIVE (Weeks 1-4)
- **Code Completion** - Method and class autocompletion
- **Enhanced Error Display** - Clear, actionable error messages
- **Session Persistence** - Remember connection state across restarts
- **Command History** - Persistent command history
- **Basic Theme System** - Light/dark terminal themes foundation

## Development Workflow

### Elite Squad Development Process
1. **Session Kickoff**: Director Agent assesses current state and provides guidance
2. **Feature Development**: Software Engineer Agent handles Rust/Smalltalk implementation
3. **Quality Assurance**: Collaboration Agent ensures code quality and testing
4. **Workflow Management**: Git Workflow Agent manages version control and branches
5. **UX Integration**: UX Expert and UI Implementor Agents for interface improvements

### Current Development Focus
- **Immediate**: Code completion system and enhanced error handling
- **Short-term**: Session persistence and theme system foundation
- **Medium-term**: Object inspector and class browser tools
- **Long-term**: AI assistant integration and multi-dialect support

## Next Development Session

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Activate Director Agent**: Assess current Phase 2 progress
2. **Software Engineer Agent**: Implement code completion system
3. **Git Workflow Agent**: Manage feature branch and testing
4. **Collaboration Agent**: Ensure code quality and integration

### Success Metrics
- **Code Completion**: Method and class autocompletion working
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages displayed
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 88+ tests passing
- **Integration**: Seamless Rust ↔ Pharo communication
