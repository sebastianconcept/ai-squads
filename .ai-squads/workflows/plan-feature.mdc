# Cursor Rule: Plan Feature with SquadsAI

## Overview
This rule provides guidance for planning new features using the SquadsAI system. It integrates with the `plan-feature.sh` script and follows established planning workflows.

**Location**: `ai-squads/workflows/plan-feature.mdc`
**Workflow Reference**: `ai-squads/workflows/planning-workflows.md`

## When to Use
- Planning a new feature for an existing project
- Need comprehensive documentation and task breakdown
- Want to follow SquadsAI quality standards and workflows
- Need squad coordination and agent assignments

## Quick Start
Use the `plan-feature.sh` script to create comprehensive feature planning:

```bash
# Basic usage
./scripts/plan-feature.sh <project_name> <feature_name>

# With options
./scripts/plan-feature.sh stui user-authentication --priority high --squad elite
```

## What Gets Created
The script automatically creates:
- `feature-[FEATURE_NAME]/` directory structure
- `problem.md` - Problem definition and analysis
- `solution.md` - Solution design and approach
- `jtbd-analysis.md` - Customer jobs and satisfaction analysis
- `goal.md` - Success criteria and acceptance criteria
- `specs.md` - Technical specifications and requirements
- `tasks.md` - Task breakdown with agent assignments
- `status.md` - Current status and progress tracking
- `implementation-status.md` - Implementation phase tracking
- `.cursor-rule.md` - Feature-specific Cursor integration

## Planning Workflow
1. **Execute Script**: Run `plan-feature.sh` with project and feature names
2. **JTBD Analysis**: @agent:jtbd-expert validates customer job alignment
3. **Review Documents**: Examine generated planning documents
4. **Customize Content**: Update templates with specific feature details
5. **Validate with Squad**: Review planning with appropriate squad agents
6. **Begin Implementation**: Follow task breakdown and quality gates

## Integration with SquadsAI
- **Automatic Validation**: Script validates project exists and configuration
- **JTBD Integration**: @agent:jtbd-expert validates customer job alignment
- **Template Integration**: Uses established document templates
- **Squad Coordination**: Integrates with squad system and agent assignments
- **Status Tracking**: Creates comprehensive progress tracking
- **Quality Gates**: Follows established quality standards including JTBD validation

## Available Options
- `--priority`: Set feature priority (low/medium/high)
- `--squad`: Specify squad to use (default: auto-detect)
- `--template`: Custom template directory
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed output

## Best Practices
1. **Start with Script**: Always use `plan-feature.sh` for consistency
2. **JTBD Validation**: Ensure customer jobs are clearly identified and validated
3. **Customize Templates**: Update generated documents with specific details
4. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to SquadsAI quality gates and coding standards
5. **Update Status**: Keep status files current as work progresses
6. **Squad Coordination**: Work with assigned agents for specialized tasks

## Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Plan the feature
./scripts/plan-feature.sh myapp user-authentication --priority high

# 2. Review generated documents
cat ai-squads/projects/myapp/feature-user-authentication/problem.md
cat ai-squads/projects/myapp/feature-user-authentication/jtbd-analysis.md
cat ai-squads/projects/myapp/feature-user-authentication/tasks.md

# 3. Customize content with specific details
# Edit the generated files with your feature specifics

# 4. Begin implementation following task breakdown
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Project Not Found**: Ensure project exists in `ai-squads/projects/`
- **Template Issues**: Check `templates/projects/` directory exists
- **Permission Errors**: Make script executable with `chmod +x scripts/plan-feature.sh`
- **Missing Files**: Verify all required project files exist

## Related Commands
- `./scripts/link.sh` - Link SquadsAI rules to target repository
- `./scripts/create-squad.sh` - Create new squad configuration
- `./scripts/create-resource.sh` - Create new resource definition

## Integration with Cursor
This rule works seamlessly with Cursor's AI assistance:
- Provides context for feature planning
- Integrates with existing SquadsAI workflows
- Maintains consistency across projects
- Enables automated documentation generation

## Integration with Planning Workflows

This Cursor rule is part of the comprehensive SquadsAI planning system:

- **Workflow Definition**: See `ai-squads/workflows/planning-workflows.md` for complete workflow documentation
- **Script Implementation**: The `plan-feature.sh` script automates this workflow
- **Template Integration**: Uses established document templates from `templates/projects/`
- **Quality Standards**: Follows SquadsAI quality gates and coding standards
- **Squad Coordination**: Integrates with squad system and agent assignments

```

## Quality Standards
All feature planning follows SquadsAI quality gates:
- **Completeness**: All required documents created
- **Clarity**: Clear problem and solution definitions
- **JTBD Validation**: Customer jobs identified and solution alignment validated
- **Feasibility**: Technical and resource feasibility confirmed
- **Alignment**: Alignment with project and squad goals

## Next Steps
After feature planning:
1. Review and validate planning with squad
2. Validate JTBD analysis and customer job alignment
3. Begin implementation following task breakdown
4. Update status files as work progresses
5. Follow quality gates and standards
6. Coordinate with squad agents for specialized work
