# AI Squads System Rules

## System Overview

AI Squads is a config-oriented system for managing AI agent teams in software projects. It provides specialist agents, code style standards, and workflows for project planning and code review.

## Core Principles

1. **Configuration-Driven**: All agents, standards, and workflows are defined in `.mdc` files for easy adjustment
2. **Project Isolation**: Each project adopts ai-squads independently via git submodule
3. **Agent Specialization**: Agents are specialists in specific technologies or domains
4. **Style Consistency**: Agents reference code style standards for consistent guidance
5. **Developer-Oriented**: Documentation and templates are brief, clear, and actionable

## File Structure

- `ai-squads/agents/` - Agent definitions
- `ai-squads/standards/code/` - Code style standards
- `ai-squads/commands/` - Command workflow definitions
- `commands/` - Global commands (installed to ~/.cursor/commands/)
- `templates/` - Document and command templates
- `scripts/` - Shell scripts for file operations

## Agent System

- Agents are defined in `ai-squads/agents/*.mdc`
- Each agent has specialization, rules, capabilities, and style guide references
- Agents can be combined into teams per project
- Team configuration stored in `ai-squads-docs/team.md`

## Command System

- Global commands installed to `~/.cursor/commands/`
- Project commands copied to `.cursor/commands/` during adoption
- Commands reference workflow rules from `ai-squads/commands/`
- Workflows define step-by-step processes

## Project Structure

When a project adopts ai-squads:
- `ai-squads/` - Git submodule containing ai-squads
- `ai-squads-docs/` - Project planning documentation
- `.cursor/commands/` - Project-specific commands

## Documentation Standards

- Brief and clear
- Developer-oriented
- Actionable
- Use markdown format
- Include examples where helpful

## Style Guides

- Located in `ai-squads/standards/code/`
- Referenced by relevant agents
- Applied during code review
- Updated as needed for consistency

## Workflow Execution

- Commands trigger workflows defined in `ai-squads/commands/`
- Workflows use agents and style guides
- Scripts handle file operations
- AI handles interactive prompts and document generation

## Best Practices

- Keep agent rules succinct and focused
- Update style guides based on team feedback
- Document decisions in `ai-squads-docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Review and refine workflows regularly
- Maintain consistency across projects
