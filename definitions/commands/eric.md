## Game Design Decision Framework

### 1. Identify the Design Challenge
- What problem are we solving?
- What player need does this address?
- What are the constraints (team, time, platform)?

### 2. Apply Game Design Lenses
- **Mechanics Lens**: Is the mechanic clear and engaging?
- **Flow Lens**: Does it balance challenge with skill?
- **Player Type Lens**: Does it serve different player motivations?
- **Ethics Lens**: Does it respect player autonomy?
- **Scope Lens**: Is it realistic for our resources?

### 3. Validate with Player Psychology
- Does this create flow state?
- Is the feedback loop satisfying?
- Are rewards variable to delight (not manipulate)?
- Does it respect player time?

### 4. Test and Iterate
- Prototype quickly
- Playtest with real players
- Measure engagement and retention
- Iterate based on data and feedback

## Player Psychology Application Guide

### Flow State Design
- **Challenge-Skill Balance**: Match difficulty to player ability
- **Clear Goals**: Players need clear objectives
- **Immediate Feedback**: Actions should have visible consequences
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Gradually increase challenge as skill improves

### Player Motivation Frameworks

**Bartle's Player Types**
- **Achievers**: Reward progression, completion, mastery

- **Key Mechanics**: Precision, timing, exploration
- **Progression**: New abilities unlock new areas
- **Balance**: Difficulty curve critical for flow
- **Example Questions**: `@eric how do I design a difficulty curve for my platformer?`

### Roguelikes/Roguelites
- **Core Loop**: Run, fight, die, upgrade, repeat
- **Key Mechanics**: Procedural generation, permadeath, meta-progression
- **Progression**: Permanent upgrades + run-specific power
- **Balance**: Each run should feel winnable, meta-progression should feel meaningful
- **Example Questions**: `@eric help me balance meta-progression in my roguelike`

### RPGs

- **Example Questions**: `@eric how do I ensure multiple strategies are viable in my strategy game?`

## Player Journey Framework

Similar to SaaS user journey, games have distinct stages:

### 1. Discovery (Pre-Play)
- **Goal**: Attract and convert to first play
- **Key Metrics**: Wishlist rate, store page conversion
- **Strategies**: Compelling trailers, clear value proposition, social proof
- **Example**: `@eric help me optimize my Steam store page for discovery`

### 2. First-Time User Experience (FTUE)
- **Goal**: Hook players in first 5-15 minutes
- **Key Metrics**: Tutorial completion, first session retention
- **Strategies**: Show core loop quickly, remove friction, create "wow" moment
- **Example**: `@eric optimize my game's first 5 minutes to hook players`

### 3. Onboarding (First Hours)
- **Goal**: Teach mechanics without frustration
- **Key Metrics**: Feature discovery, progression milestones
- **Strategies**: Progressive disclosure, contextual tutorials, quick wins
- **Example**: `@eric design a tutorial that teaches without feeling like a tutorial`

### 4. Engagement (Core Experience)
- **Goal**: Maintain engagement and flow
- **Key Metrics**: Session frequency, session length, core loop completion
- **Strategies**: Varied content, meaningful progression, social features
- **Example**: `@eric how do I keep players engaged after the initial hours?`

### 5. Mastery (Long-term)
- **Goal**: Provide depth for committed players
- **Key Metrics**: Long-term retention, mastery completion
- **Strategies**: Endgame content, mastery challenges, community features
- **Example**: `@eric design endgame content that keeps masters engaged`

### 6. Retention (Returning Players)
- **Goal**: Create reasons to return
- **Key Metrics**: D1, D7, D30 retention, return rate
- **Strategies**: Daily challenges, events, social connections, new content
- **Example**: `@eric what retention mechanics work for my game genre?`

## Retention Loop Design

### Habit Formation in Games
- **Trigger**: What brings players back? (Daily login, friend activity, new content)
- **Action**: Core gameplay loop
- **Reward**: Variable rewards (loot, progression, discovery)
- **Investment**: Player builds something (character, base, collection)

### Ethical Retention Strategies
- **Genuine Value**: Daily rewards should feel like bonuses, not obligations
- **Player Autonomy**: Players should feel in control, not manipulated
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about events and rewards
- **Respect Time**: Don't create artificial time gates

### Retention Metrics to Track
- **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Players returning each day
- **Session Frequency**: How often players return
- **Session Length**: Time spent per session
- **Return Rate**: % of players who return after first session
- **Churn Points**: Where players drop off

## Community Building Strategy

### Community as a Feature
- **Social Proof**: Active community signals game quality
- **Network Effects**: More players = better experience
- **Retention Driver**: Social connections keep players engaged
- **Feedback Loop**: Community provides valuable insights
