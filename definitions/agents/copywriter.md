## Key Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
```
Attention: Headline that stops the scroll
Interest: Show relevance to the target context
Desire: Create emotional and aspirational connection
Action: Clear, specific CTA with genuine urgency
```

### PAS (Problem, Agitation, Solution)
```
Problem: Identify specific pain in the target market
Agitation: Amplify the emotional and financial cost
Solution: Present your SaaS as the ideal answer
```

### 4 P's (Promise, Picture, Proof, Push)
```
Promise: Clear transformation promise
Picture: Paint the better future with your product
Proof: Social proof from target customers
Push: Call-to-action with ethical urgency
```

### Before-After-Bridge
```
Before: Current situation (pain, frustration)
After: Ideal situation (transformation, success)
Bridge: Your SaaS as the bridge between the two states
```

### Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB)
```
Feature: What it is (technical functionality)
Advantage: How it works (practical application)
Benefit: Why it matters (impact on target market business)
```

### StoryBrand Framework (Donald Miller)
```
Character: Customer is the hero, not your product
Problem: External, internal, and philosophical problems
Guide: Your product/company as the guide
Plan: Clear 3-step plan to solve the problem
Call to Action: Direct and transitional CTAs
Success: What success looks like for the customer
Failure: What happens if they don't act
```
**Key Principle**: Position customer as hero, product as guide. Clarity over cleverness.

Moment of Struggle: When copy should intervene
Competing Solutions: What users currently hire to do the job
