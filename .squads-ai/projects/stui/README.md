# STUI Project - SquadsAI Integration

## Overview

STUI has been successfully adopted into the **Elite Squad** of SquadsAI, providing access to specialized agents and workflows for Rust and Smalltalk/Pharo development.

## Project Status

- **Status**: ✅ Successfully Adopted
- **Squad**: Elite Squad (Rust and Smalltalk/Pharo Development)
- **Adoption Date**: 2025-08-23
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Development Tools (Active)

## Quick Start

### For Development Sessions
1. **Start with Director Agent**: Always begin with `@agent:director` for session kickoff
2. **Use Elite Squad Workflow**: Follow the specialized Rust/Smalltalk development process
3. **Leverage Squad Agents**: Access specialized agents for different development tasks

### Available Agents
- **@agent:director** - Session kickoff and project guidance
- **@agent:software-engineer** - Rust/Smalltalk development and architecture
- **@agent:git-workflow** - Version control and workflow management
- **@agent:collaboration** - Team coordination and quality assurance
- **@agent:ux-expert** - User experience research and design
- **@agent:ui-implementor** - Frontend implementation across platforms
- **@agent:product-planner** - Strategic product planning and development

## Project Documentation

### Core Documents
- **[project.md](project.md)** - Project overview and integration details
- **[status.md](status.md)** - Current status and progress tracking
- **[elite-workflow.md](elite-workflow.md)** - Elite squad development workflow
- **[adoption-workflow.md](adoption-workflow.md)** - Adoption process and results

### Key Information
- **Technology Stack**: Rust TUI client + Smalltalk/Pharo backend + ZeroMQ networking
- **Architecture**: Facade pattern supporting multiple Smalltalk dialects
- **Current Focus**: Phase 2 - Code completion, error handling, session persistence
- **Test Coverage**: 88+ tests passing with comprehensive integration testing

## Development Workflow

### Elite Squad Process
1. **Session Kickoff**: Director Agent assesses current state and provides guidance
2. **Feature Development**: Software Engineer Agent handles Rust/Smalltalk implementation
3. **Quality Assurance**: Collaboration Agent ensures code quality and testing
4. **Workflow Management**: Git Workflow Agent manages version control and branches
5. **UX Integration**: UX Expert and UI Implementor Agents for interface improvements

### Current Priorities
- **Immediate**: Code completion system and enhanced error handling
- **Short-term**: Session persistence and theme system foundation
- **Medium-term**: Object inspector and class browser tools
- **Long-term**: AI assistant integration and multi-dialect support

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 88+ tests passing
- **Performance**: ZeroMQ networking performance targets
- **Quality**: Code review completion and quality standards
- **Progress**: Phase 2 feature completion on schedule

### Integration Metrics
- **Rust ↔ Pharo**: Seamless communication and integration
- **Network Performance**: Reliable ZeroMQ communication
- **User Experience**: Professional interface and workflow
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples

## Next Steps

### For Next Development Session
1. **Activate Director Agent**: Assess current Phase 2 progress
2. **Software Engineer Agent**: Implement code completion system
3. **Git Workflow Agent**: Manage feature branch and testing
4. **Collaboration Agent**: Ensure code quality and integration

### Success Criteria
- **Code Completion**: Method and class autocompletion working
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages displayed
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 88+ tests passing
- **Integration**: Seamless Rust ↔ Pharo communication
