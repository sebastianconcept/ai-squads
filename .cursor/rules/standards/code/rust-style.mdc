# Rust Code Style Standards

## General Principles

- Prefer safe code over unsafe
- Use appropriate error handling with Result types
- Consider performance implications of design choices
- Follow Rust ownership and borrowing rules strictly

## Code Organization

- Use modules to organize code logically
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Prefer composition over inheritance (traits over structs)

## Error Handling

- Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- Prefer custom error types implementing `std::error::Error`
- Use `?` operator for error propagation
- Avoid unwrap() in production code; use expect() with clear messages if needed

## Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for functions, variables, modules
- Use PascalCase for types, traits, enums
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that convey intent

## Ownership and Borrowing

- Prefer borrowing (&) over ownership when possible
- Use references for read-only access
- Use mutable references (&mut) only when necessary
- Consider using Rc/Arc for shared ownership when needed

## Performance

- Prefer iterators over manual loops
- Use slice patterns when appropriate
- Consider zero-cost abstractions
- Profile before optimizing

## Documentation

- Use /// for public API documentation
- Include examples in doc comments
- Document error conditions
- Keep documentation up to date

## Testing

- Write unit tests alongside code
- Use #[cfg(test)] for test modules
- Test error paths, not just happy paths
- Use integration tests for public APIs
