# Invoke Agent Workflow

This workflow guides the invocation of specific AI agents for help.

## Prerequisites

1. Project should have ai-squads available (as submodule or globally)
2. Current context (file, selection, project) available

## Steps

### 1. List Available Agents
Load agents from `ai-squads/.cursor/rules/agents/`:
- Rust Specialist
- Smalltalk Specialist
- JavaScript Specialist
- Jobs to be Done
- UI/UX Agent
- UI Developer

### 2. Gather Context
Collect current context:
- Current file path and content
- Selected text (if any)
- Project root directory
- Project tech stack (if available from `ai-squads-docs/tech-stack.md`)
- Project team (if available from `ai-squads-docs/team.md`)

### 3. Select Agent(s)
- Present list of available agents
- Allow user to select one or more agents
- Suggest agents based on current file type if applicable

### 4. Load Agent Rules
For each selected agent:
- Load agent definition from `ai-squads/.cursor/rules/agents/{agent-name}.mdc`
- Load referenced style guides
- Understand agent capabilities and specialization

### 5. Prepare Query
Based on context:
- If file selected: focus on that file's content
- If text selected: focus on selected portion
- If no selection: provide general context
- Include relevant project information

### 6. Generate Response
Using agent rules and style guides:
- Apply agent's specialization and rules
- Reference relevant style guides
- Provide context-aware guidance
- Use agent's capabilities appropriately

### 7. Present Response
Format response clearly:
- Agent name and specialization
- Response to query
- Relevant code examples (if applicable)
- References to style guides
- Additional resources or suggestions

## Output

A specialized response from the selected agent(s) that:
- Addresses the user's query
- Applies agent's rules and guidelines
- References relevant style guides
- Provides actionable guidance
- Considers project context

## Notes

- Multiple agents can be invoked simultaneously
- Agents can complement each other
- Context is crucial for quality responses
- Reference style guides when providing code guidance
- Keep responses focused and actionable
