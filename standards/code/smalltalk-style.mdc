# Smalltalk/Pharo Code Style Standards

## General Principles

- Embrace object-oriented design fully
- Prefer message passing over direct manipulation
- Use polymorphism and dynamic dispatch
- Follow Smalltalk naming conventions

## Code Organization

- Organize code in packages/namespaces logically
- Keep classes focused and cohesive
- Use categories to organize methods within classes
- Group related methods together

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for all identifiers
- Use descriptive names that read like English
- Method names should be verbs (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `findUserById`)
- Class names should be nouns (e.g., `User`, `PaymentProcessor`)
- Boolean methods should end with `?` (e.g., `isEmpty?`, `isValid?`)

## Method Design

- Keep methods small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use method chaining when it improves readability
- Return self for fluent interfaces when appropriate

## Collections and Iteration

- Prefer collection methods over manual loops
- Use `do:`, `collect:`, `select:`, `reject:`, `detect:` appropriately
- Understand the difference between `#do:` and `#collect:`
- Use `#inject:into:` for reductions/accumulations

## Error Handling

- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use signal/exception hierarchy appropriately
- Handle exceptions at appropriate levels

## Testing

- Write tests using SUnit
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use test fixtures appropriately
- Keep tests readable and maintainable

## Debugging

- Use the debugger effectively
- Understand the execution stack
- Use inspectors to explore objects
- Leverage the development environment

## Documentation

- Use class comments to describe purpose
- Document method contracts (preconditions, postconditions)
- Include usage examples
- Keep comments up to date with code
